# FantasyFootballByeWeekDraftingTool

This is a tool I developed in order to help me draft my fantasy football teams in accordance with my favored strategy - stacking all my players on the same bye week! (Note: this strategy has yet to result in any championships for me.)

Based on average ADP from multiple sources, I am able to chart out probable draft scenarios for whatever spot I am given in the draft order and determine which is the best bye week to commit to. I plot the scores (lower being better) of teams drafted for each bye week at multiple round breakpoints to better understand which bye weeks are top heavy vs. deep for that draft spot.

Now, could I have just guessed that weeks 7 and 13 would consistently be the best bye weeks to choose based off the caliber of teams for those weeks in 2023? ....probably. But there may be a certain bye week that just worked out well for a specific draft spot, and in the end it's nice to know that I at least didn't miss that.
